MAIN GOAL
 Create a program that allows the user to input the sides of any triangle,
 and then return whether the triangle is a Pythagorean Triple or not.
SUB-GOALS
 If your program requires users to input the sides in a specific order,
 change the coding so the user can type in the sides in any order.
 Remember, the hypotenuse (c) is always the longest side.

 Loop the program so the user can use it more than once without having to
 restart the program.
